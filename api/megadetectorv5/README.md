# Setup Instructions

In order to create and deploy the Megadetector model archive from scratch, we need to work across two different environments

1. your local environment, where you will:
   1. Download the model weights from s3
   2. Install dependencies for `torch-model-archiver`
   3. Run `torch-model-archiver` to generate the .mar archive
   4. Upload the model archive to s3

2. The Sagemaker notebook environment where you will:
   1. download the .mar archive
   2. build the deploy image and push to ECR
   3. create a serverless endpoint configuration
   4. deploy and test a serverless endpoint

## Download weights and torchscript model

From this directory, run:
```
aws s3 sync s3://animl-model-zoo/mdv5-weights-models/ model-weights
```

If you want to quickly run model inference outside of the deployment environment without post processing steps, you can use the torchscript model. We'll use the model weights, 'md_v5a.0.0.pt', to create a .mar archive.

## Download yolov5 source for model archiving and run model archiver

Before creating our model archive, we need to download the full yolov5 source code we use to load the model weights. We'll use torch hub for this. Open ipython and run

```python
import torch
model = torch.hub.load('ultralytics/yolov5', 'yolov5s', device='cpu')
```

you should see

```python

and if you run the torch hub load command again, you will see where the source has been downloaded

```
Using cache found in /root/.cache/torch/hub/ultralytics_yolov5_master
```

You path to the .cache will likely differ! Edit it in the following step.

We'll use the yolov5 source when archiving the model for deployment. Currently we are using [yolov5 commit hash 5c91da](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/tree/5c91daeaecaeca709b8b6d13bd571d068fdbd003)

`pip install torch-model-archiver` then,

```
torch-model-archiver --model-name mdv5 --version 1.0.0 --serialized-file model-weights/md_v5a.0.0.pt --extra-files index_to_name.json --extra-files /root/.cache/torch/hub/ultralytics_yolov5_master/ --handler mdv5_handler.py
mv mdv5.mar model_store/mdv5a.mar
```

The .mar file is what is served by torchserve on the serverless endpoint and includes the handler code that processes image requests, the model weights defining what the Megadetector model has learned, and the model structure defined by the yolov5 code.

We can locally test this model prior to deploying.

## Locally build and serve the torchscript model with torchserve

```
docker build -t torchserve-mdv5a:0.5.3-cpu .
bash docker_mdv5.sh model_store
```

## Return prediction in normalized coordinates with category integer and confidence score

```
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/predictions/mdv5 -T ../../input/sample-img-fox.jpg
```

Note: In the past we attempted to adapt the Dockerfile to address an issue with the libjpeg version. We used conda to install dependencies, including torchserve, because conda installs the version of libjpeg that was used to train and test Megadetector originally. See this issue for more detail https://github.com/pytorch/serve/issues/2054. We [reverted this change](https://github.com/tnc-ca-geo/animl-ml/pull/98/commits/b2bbff5316fbb15023025b2373dcdc9354dd26a7) because installing from conda ballooned the image size above the 10Gb limit set by Sagemaker Serverless. The results are virtually equivalent with the different libjpeg version.


# Deploying the model to a Sagemaker Serverless Endpoint

Once you have run the model archiver step above, you're ready to upload that model to s3 so it can be deployed to a serverless inference endpoint!

Run 


`aws s3 cp model_store/mdv5a.mar s3://animl-model-zoo/`

to copy the model to the appropriate s3 bucket where pytorch and tensorflow models (for MIRA) are stored.

You'll also need to push the locally built docker image to the ECR repository. Sinc ethe images are large, it is fastest to do this from a sagemaker notebook instance in the mdv5_deploy.ipynb. Instructions are below if you want to do this from your local machine anyway.

```
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-west-2 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 830244800171.dkr.ecr.us-w
est-2.amazonaws.com

docker tag cv2-torchserve:0.5.3-cpu 830244800171.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/torchserve-mdv5-sagemaker:latest

docker push 830244800171.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/torchserve-mdv5-sagemaker:latest
```

then open the jupyter notebook titled mdv5_deploy.ipynb from a Sagemaker Notebook instance. You can also run this deploy notebook locally but would need to set up dependencies so the notebook instance is recommended.


## Sidenote, exporting yolov5 weights as torchscript model

First, clone and install yolov5 dependencies and yolov5 following these instructions: https://docs.ultralytics.com/tutorials/torchscript-onnx-coreml-export/

Then, if running locally, make sure to install the correct version of torch and torchvision, the same versions used to save the torchscript megadetector model, we need to use these to load the torchscript model. Check the Dockerfile for versions.

Size needs to be same as in mdv5_handler.py for good performance. Run this from this directory 
```
python ../../../yolov5/export.py --weights model-weights/md_v5a.0.0.pt --img 1280 1280 --batch 1 
```
this will create models/megadetectorv5/md_v5a.0.0.torchscript , which will expect a fixed image size input of 1280 x 1280 and a one image at a time (batch size of 1).
